# Flexonizer

Flexonizer is a simple application for tracking your tasks on your PC or Mac.
It automatically categorizes your given tasks in the category A, B, or C.
"A-Tasks" are your most recent and important tasks (<1 month until the deadline is reached)
"B-Tasks" are important an categorized (> 1month and < 3 months ist orange, > 3 months is green)
"C-Tasks" don't have a deadline and are not really important to do.

This is, what the application looks like when having some tasks created:

For creating a task, you can easily switch the tab of the tabpane:

As you can see, the app automatically tracks your done tasks (it only tracks for "A-Tasks", since they are the only tasks, that can be done too late). Of course you can also reset that statistic ans start from scratch.

The application automatically saves and reads from a save.txt in your user-directory-folder in a folder called Flexonizer.
